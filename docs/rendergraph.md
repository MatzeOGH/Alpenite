# Render Graph

The render graph is an immediate-mode frame scheduler for WebGPU
(`webgpu/base/RenderGraph.h`, namespace `webgpu::rg`). Each frame, you declare the resources and
passes that the frame needs. The graph compiles them into an execution order. It manages resource
lifetimes and records the passes into your command encoder.

The graph owns two things: pass order and resource lifetime. It is not a GPU-API wrapper. The pass
bodies call `wgpu*` functions directly.

> The header [`webgpu/base/RenderGraph.h`](../webgpu/base/RenderGraph.h) is the per-call
> reference. Every public declaration carries its parameters, defaults, and constraints. This
> document shows how the pieces fit together, with worked examples. It does not restate the
> signatures.

## What it is

Three concepts carry the whole API.

A resource is a GPU texture or buffer that the graph knows about. Most resources are transient. The
graph declares them fresh every frame and allocates them from a pool. Two transients can also share
the same GPU memory when their lifetimes do not overlap. External objects such as the swapchain are
imported instead.

A resource declaration returns a handle. `ResourceHandle` is a small value type that names the
resource for this frame. Handles are cheap to copy. You pass them between systems and capture them
into pass lambdas. A handle never carries the GPU object itself. The graph resolves a handle to a
real `WGPUTexture` or `WGPUBuffer` only during execution.

The creators return the kind-tagged `TextureHandle` or `BufferHandle`, and the declarations take
those types. So a buffer passed to `sampled()` fails to compile instead of an assert at run time.
Both types convert to `ResourceHandle` for the calls that accept either, such as `bind()`, but never
the reverse. Store handles in their typed form, and prefer `auto` for locals.

A pass is a unit of GPU work that you declare with `add_pass`. It names every resource it reads and
writes, and the graph derives the order from those declarations. The graph culls a pass whose output
nothing consumes, unless you mark it `force_keep()`.

`add_pass` takes two lambdas, and the split between them is the core of the API. Setup runs
immediately, at record time. It receives a `PassBuilder&` and declares the accesses: attachments,
sampled textures, storage buffers, copies. No GPU work happens in setup. Execute runs later, inside
`execute()`, after the graph schedules the passes and realizes the resources. It receives a
`PassContext&` that resolves handles to live GPU objects and holds the encoders. You record the draw,
dispatch, and copy commands in execute.

### A frame at a glance

A typical deferred frame follows. Passes (rectangles) declare reads and writes of resources
(rounded). The graph derives every arrow from those declarations. The swapchain is imported, so the
pass that writes it is a sink and the graph cannot cull it.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph passes [ ]
        direction LR
        Tiles["Tiles<br/>(Graphics)"]
        Atmos["Atmosphere<br/>(Graphics)"]
        Clouds["CloudsRender<br/>(Compute)"]
        Light["Lighting<br/>(Graphics)"]
        Comp["Composite<br/>(Graphics)"]
    end

    gbuffer(["gbuffer<br/>albedo/normal/depth"])
    atmoRT(["atmosphere.rt"])
    cloudTex(["clouds.color"])
    lit(["lit.color"])
    swap[["swapchain<br/>(imported sink)"]]

    Tiles --> gbuffer
    gbuffer --> Light
    Atmos --> atmoRT
    gbuffer --> Clouds
    Clouds --> cloudTex
    Light --> lit
    lit --> Comp
    atmoRT --> Comp
    cloudTex --> Comp
    Comp --> swap
```

`Composite` transitively feeds the imported `swapchain`, so every pass above survives culling. If you
drop the `Composite -> swapchain` edge, for example when nothing reads `lit`, the whole chain becomes
dead. See [Ordering and culling](#ordering-and-culling).

---

## The frame loop

The call order is a contract. Follow it exactly.

```cpp
// Startup, once:
webgpu::rg::GraphAllocator* allocator = webgpu::rg::create_allocator();

// Every frame:
webgpu::rg::begin_frame(allocator);
webgpu::rg::RenderGraph* rg = webgpu::rg::start_recording(allocator);

// Import the swapchain first if a pass renders to it (imports happen during recording):
auto swapchain = rg->import_texture("swapchain",
    { .view = surface_view, .size = { size.x, size.y, 1 }, .format = surface_format });

// ...declare resources and passes...

// once, after all passes are declared. returns the error chain, and is [[nodiscard]]:
// an unchecked compile() is how a broken frame becomes a silent black screen.
for (auto* e = rg->compile(); e; e = e->next)      // always check. see Debugging.
    qCritical("%.*s", (int)e->message.length, e->message.data);

rg->execute(device, queue, encoder, /*enableProfiling*/ false);
// ...submit the encoder to the queue yourself...
rg->collect_gpu_timings();            // safe always. no-op unless profiling was on.
webgpu::rg::end_frame(allocator);     // after the queue submit

// Shutdown, once:
webgpu::rg::destroy_allocator(allocator);
```

Three order constraints cause most of the bugs here:

1. Every `import_*`, `create_*`, and `add_pass` runs before `compile()`. After compile, the graph is
   frozen.
2. `end_frame()` runs after you submit the encoder, not before. The commands you submit still
   reference the graph's pooled objects.
3. You own the encoder and the submit. The graph records into your encoder and never submits for you.

You can use several graphs per frame. A later graph can reuse an earlier graph's pooled transients.
This reuse assumes that you submit the graphs in execution order on one queue.

---

## Resources

Every object a pass touches must be a graph resource, declared before `compile()`. There are five
kinds. They differ in who owns the GPU object and how long it lives.

| Kind | Lifetime | Create with | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Transient (default) | this frame | `create_transient_texture` / `_buffer` | intermediate targets, scratch |
| Import | caller-owned | `import_texture` / `import_buffer` | swapchain, objects other systems own |
| History | cross-frame ping-pong | `create_history_texture` / `_buffer` | temporal effects (TAA, reprojection) |
| Persistent | cross-frame, one object | `create_persistent_texture` / `_buffer` | graph-owned caches |
| Initialized | cross-frame, baked once | `create_initialized_texture` / `_buffer` | fallbacks for optional bind slots |

Default to transient. Use the others only when you need cross-frame memory.

```cpp
auto rt = rg->create_transient_texture("atmosphere.rt", rg::texture_2d(WGPUTextureFormat_RGBA8Unorm, w, h));
```

### Describing a texture

`TextureDesc` has two size arms that exclude each other: absolute (`width`/`height`) and relative
(`scaleX`/`scaleY`/`relativeTo`). The factories set `dimension` and exactly one arm. So you cannot
write the combinations that the graph would silently ignore:

| Factory | Produces |
|---|---|
| `texture_2d(format, w, h)` | the common case |
| `texture_2d_array(format, w, h, layers)` | 2D array |
| `texture_cube(format, size)` | 6 square layers, sample with `rg::cube()` |
| `texture_cube_array(format, size, cubes)` | `6*cubes` square layers |
| `texture_3d(format, w, h, depth)` | volume |
| `texture_relative(format, base, scale)` | sized off `base`, uniform or per-axis |

The tail options chain onto any of them and return a modified copy:

```cpp
rg::texture_2d(fmt, w, h).samples(4)                     // MSAA
rg::texture_cube(fmt, 128).mips(kRoughnessMips)          // prefiltered environment map
rg::texture_relative(fmt, hdrColor, 0.5f).layers(2)      // half-res, 2 array layers
```

Prefer `texture_cube()` over 6 layers written by hand. It takes one size, so you cannot express
non-square faces, which WebGPU rejects.

`TextureDesc` is still a plain aggregate, so direct initialization also works. It is the escape hatch
when a factory does not fit:

```cpp
webgpu::rg::TextureDesc desc {
    .dimension = WGPUTextureDimension_2D,
    .format    = WGPUTextureFormat_RGBA8Unorm,
    .width     = w,
    .height    = h,
};
```

Nothing checks that the arm you filled matches the `sizeKind` you set on that path. This is the
mistake that the factories exist to prevent.

### Relative sizing

`TextureDesc::sizeKind = Relative` sizes a texture at `scaleX` and `scaleY` times the size of
`relativeTo`. So a half-resolution pass tracks its source through window resizes, and you recompute
nothing:

```cpp
auto half = rg->create_transient_texture("bloom.half",
    rg::texture_relative(WGPUTextureFormat_RGBA16Float, fullResColor, 0.5f));
```

`relativeTo` can itself be relative. The chain resolves at `compile()`. A cycle is a compile error,
not a hang.

Known limitation: view-format reinterpretation is not supported. WebGPU needs the reinterpret formats
listed at texture creation, and `TextureDesc` does not plumb `viewFormats` yet.

### Transient aliasing

With aliasing on, which is `compile(true)` and the default, two transients pack onto the same GPU
object when their lifetimes do not overlap and their descriptors match (size, format, dimension, mip
and sample count, usage). A transient's lifetime runs from its first write to its last read. This
keeps peak VRAM down.

Transients with overlapping lifetimes never share, even with identical descriptors. `compile(false)`
turns aliasing off and gives every transient its own object. If a bug disappears with aliasing off, a
lifetime is wrong, usually an undeclared read or write.

Aliasing stays invisible to correctness while your declarations are honest. The graph reuses only the
memory it proves dead. The one thing you must not do is reach around the graph and cache a
transient's `WGPUTexture` or view across passes or frames. The object behind a handle can be a
different, shared one next time. Always resolve inside the pass body through `PassContext`.

### Undeclared reads and aliasing

The `ctx.*` resolvers assert that you declared the handle in this pass. So you cannot create an
undeclared read through the intended path: a missing `sampled()` makes `ctx.view()` assert-fail. The
one way past this is to stash a transient's raw view outside the graph and bind it with the free
`webgpu::bind()` (from `gpu_utils.h`) in a later pass that never declares the read:

```cpp
WGPUTextureView m_cached_normal_view = nullptr;   // a transient's view, escaped

auto normal = rg->create_transient_texture("gbuffer.normal", desc);

// Pass A legitimately writes `normal`, then caches its view "to avoid rebuilding":
rg->add_pass("GBuffer", webgpu::rg::PassKind::Graphics,
    [normal](webgpu::rg::PassBuilder& b) { b.color(normal, 0); },
    [this, normal](webgpu::rg::PassContext& c) {
        draw_gbuffer(c);
        m_cached_normal_view = c.view(normal);    // legal here, but now it has escaped the graph
    });

// ...intervening passes declare their own transients. To the graph, `normal` is dead after
//    GBuffer (no later pass declares a read), so the aliaser packs one of them onto its slot...

// Pass B reads `normal` but forgets to declare it, and binds the cached view raw:
rg->add_pass("Lighting", webgpu::rg::PassKind::Graphics,
    [lit](webgpu::rg::PassBuilder& b) {
        b.color(lit, 0);
        // BUG: no b.sampled(normal); the graph never learns Lighting reads `normal`
    },
    [this](webgpu::rg::PassContext& c) {
        webgpu::raii::BindGroup bg(c.device, *m_light_layout,
            { webgpu::bind(0, m_cached_normal_view) },   // raw bind, invisible to hazards and aliasing
            "lighting");
        wgpuRenderPassEncoderSetBindGroup(c.render_pass, 0, bg.handle(), 0, nullptr);
        wgpuRenderPassEncoderDraw(c.render_pass, 3, 1, 0, 0);
    });
```

Under `compile(false)` this looks correct. `normal` keeps its own texture, so the cached view still
points at real data. Under `compile(true)` another transient packs onto that physical slot after
GBuffer, so the same cached view now reads its pixels. The result is subtly wrong lighting from
identical code, and only aliasing flips it. The fix is to declare the read with `b.sampled(normal)`
and bind it with `c.bind(0, normal)`. Never cache the view.

### Cross-frame pooling

Aliasing packs transients within a frame. The transient pool is separate. It keeps GPU objects across
frames. At `end_frame`, the graph returns a transient's object to the pool rather than destroys it,
and next frame's matching `create_transient_*` gets it back. The graph destroys an object that stays
unclaimed for `kRetain` (4) frames. That idle window is deliberate. A pass that records on only some
frames must not pay a destroy and a create every time it skips one.

A resize would defeat that window. The graph never claims the old-size objects again, so each one
would linger 4 more frames, and a drag-resize spikes VRAM with a generation per frame. So the pool
also supersede-evicts. At `end_frame`, the graph destroys an idle entry immediately if a sibling
created this frame is the same resource at a different size.

"The same resource" is keyed on the resource's interned name, not its descriptor. Two different
transients that only differ in size look identical to a descriptor-only check. Eviction on that guess
churns without bound: the graph destroys the idle one, recreates it on its next claim, and then it
supersedes the other. That is one destroy plus one create every frame, forever, for any transient not
claimed every frame. The name key tells a genuine resize apart from a coincidence.

Remember the asymmetry when you touch this: a missed supersede only delays an evict to `kRetain`,
while a false supersede churns. When in doubt, the predicate refuses. The graph never supersedes an
entry with no identity.

### History

`create_history_texture` and `create_history_buffer` return a `HistoryTexture` or `HistoryBuffer`, a
pair of handles. Write `.curr`, read `.prev`. This frame's `.curr` becomes next frame's `.prev`. Gate
every read of `.prev` with `ctx.history_valid(history)`, and pass the pair itself rather than either
handle. It returns false on the frame that the graph recreates and clears the `.prev` object (first
use, resize, reset). Skip the history sample then. A non-zero `hash` invalidates the history whenever
the hash changes.

The two backing textures ping-pong. Frame N writes buffer A and reads B. Frame N+1 writes B and reads
A. The dashed edge is the cross-frame carry that the graph tracks for you:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph fN [Frame N]
        pN["TAA"] --> currN(["curr = A"])
        prevN(["prev = B"]) --> pN
    end
    subgraph fN1 [Frame N+1]
        pN1["TAA"] --> currN1(["curr = B"])
        prevN1(["prev = A"]) --> pN1
    end
    currN -. "becomes prev" .-> prevN1
    currN1 -. "becomes prev" .-> prevN
```

`.prev` is meaningful only when the last frame actually wrote `.curr` into the same pool entry. It is
not meaningful on the first frame, the frame after a resize, or any frame that invalidated the
history. In all of these, the graph just recreated the backing object, and it holds no prior result.
`ctx.history_valid(history)` folds all three cases into one bool. False means skip the temporal sample
this frame and fall back to the non-history path.

```cpp
// TAA: blend with history only when it is valid, otherwise output the fresh sample as-is.
float alpha = c.history_valid(history) ? 0.9f : 0.0f;   // 0 == ignore history
```

If you read `.prev` without this gate, the first frame and every frame after a reset samples cleared
or uninitialized memory: smeared or black temporal output that clears up after a frame.

### Camera cuts via the history hash

The optional `hash` on `create_history_texture` and `_buffer` is a content-identity stamp. The graph
keeps it with the pool entry. When the hash you pass differs from the stored one, the graph destroys
the entry and recreates it blank. This drops `history_valid()` to false for that frame, exactly as a
resize would. Pass the same hash and the ping-pong keeps rotating untouched.

This is the mechanism for a camera cut. On a teleport, a projection swap, or any jump where the last
frame's pixels no longer correspond to this frame's, reprojection is worse than useless. Feed a hash
that changes on the cut, and history self-resets for one frame:

```cpp
// Any value that changes exactly when temporal continuity breaks. The graph only compares it to
// last frame's, so how you derive it is yours: a counter you bump on the cut is enough.
uint64_t cut = cameraCutCounter;
auto taa = rg->create_history_texture("taa.color", desc, cut);
// The frame `cut` changes, history_valid(taa) is false, so skip the reprojected sample.
```

`hash == 0` (the default) disables hash invalidation. History then resets only on first use and
resize. You do not detect the cut frame yourself and branch. Change the hash, and let
`history_valid()` report the reset at the read site. This is the same mechanism that `initialize()`
uses for gated rebakes. See [initialize() and hash-gated rebakes](#initialize-and-hash-gated-rebakes).

### Initialized fallbacks

`create_initialized_texture` takes a `WGPUColor` fill. `create_initialized_buffer` takes an optional
`data` pointer (null zero-fills). The graph bakes the contents once and reuses them every frame. This
is the standard fallback for an optional binding slot. When a feature is off, bind a 1x1 initialized
texture instead of a change to the pipeline layout. To bake more complex content once, such as a LUT
computed by a pass, use a persistent resource plus `PassBuilder::initialize()`. See
[initialize() and hash-gated rebakes](#initialize-and-hash-gated-rebakes).

### Import

`import_texture` wraps a GPU object that the graph does not own. The caller guarantees that it stays
alive for the frame. The graph never culls imports. A write to an imported resource is an output that
leaves the frame, which is what keeps the chain to the swapchain alive.

```cpp
auto swapchain = rg->import_texture("swapchain",
    { .view = surface_view, .size = { size.x, size.y, 1 }, .format = surface_format });
```

If you pass the backing `texture`, this enables the copy family and `ctx.texture()` on this handle,
and it lets the graph build views from a declared `ViewRange` as it would for a graph-owned texture.
If you leave it null, the graph registers only the view. This restricts the handle to sample and
attach, and it makes every subresource selection moot: `ctx.view()` returns the registered view
whatever you declared. `mipCount`, `sampleCount`, and `dimension` default to a single-sample,
single-mip 2D texture. Pass the real values if the source differs. `dimension` is the source
texture's own dimension, so an array or cube source says `2D`.

### Names

Every declaration takes the resource or pass name as a `std::string_view`. The graph hashes it and
copies the name into its arena during the call. The name backs the labels, the debug UI, and the
error messages. The hash speeds up cross-frame lookups. So the view only has to be valid for that one
call, which is the ordinary `string_view` rule.

```cpp
// Both fine. The argument is alive for the duration of the call:
rg->create_transient_texture("overlay." + std::to_string(i), desc); // temporary lives to the ';'

const std::string name = "overlay." + std::to_string(i);
rg->create_transient_texture(name, desc);                           // named string, obviously alive
```

The only trap is the generic one: do not hand the graph a `string_view` into a string that is already
destroyed. String literals such as `"clouds.lo_color"` live forever and are always safe.

---

## Passes

`add_pass(id, kind, setup, execute)` declares one unit of GPU work. The `kind` decides which encoder
the body gets. For `Graphics` you do not call `wgpuCommandEncoderBeginRenderPass`. `ctx.render_pass`
arrives ready, cleared or loaded per your `color()` and `depth_stencil()` declarations.

```cpp
rg->add_pass("Atmosphere", webgpu::rg::PassKind::Graphics,
    // SETUP: runs now. Declare every resource this pass reads and writes. No GPU work.
    [&](webgpu::rg::PassBuilder& b) {
        b.color(rt, 0);
    },
    // EXECUTE: runs later inside execute(). Record the GPU commands.
    [camera_bg, pipeline = m_pipeline->pipeline().handle()](webgpu::rg::PassContext& ctx) {
        wgpuRenderPassEncoderSetBindGroup(ctx.render_pass, 0, camera_bg, 0, nullptr);
        wgpuRenderPassEncoderSetPipeline(ctx.render_pass, pipeline);
        wgpuRenderPassEncoderDraw(ctx.render_pass, 3, 1, 0, 0);
    });
return rt; // hand the handle to whoever consumes this pass's output
```

### Setup declares, execute records

The split between the two lambdas matters more than any single method.

Setup gets a `PassBuilder&` and declares every resource the pass touches: attachments (`color`,
`depth_stencil`, `resolve`), shader resources (`sampled`, `storage_read`, `storage_write`,
`storage_read_write`, `uniform`, `host_write`), buffer inputs (`vertex_buffer`, `index_buffer`,
`indirect_buffer`), and copies. Those declarations are the only thing the graph knows about the pass.
It derives the order from them, infers the usage flags from them, and decides aliasing from them.
Setup does no GPU work.

Two builder calls declare no access but change the schedule. `initialize(target, hash)` gates the pass
on a stale bake (see [initialize()](#initialize-and-hash-gated-rebakes)), and `force_keep()` exempts
it from culling (see [Ordering and culling](#ordering-and-culling)).

Execute gets a `PassContext&` and records the commands. Its resolvers (`ctx.view`, `ctx.bind`,
`ctx.texture`, `ctx.buffer`, the sizes and formats, the copy infos) each assert that you declared the
handle in this pass. That assert stops most undeclared reads at the door. The one path around it is
[Undeclared reads and aliasing](#undeclared-reads-and-aliasing).

For the per-call reference, every parameter, default, and constraint, read
[`webgpu/base/RenderGraph.h`](../webgpu/base/RenderGraph.h). It is the source of truth and is
commented for that purpose. This document does not restate it.

---

## The two rules

Break either one and you get a compile error, a crash, or silently wrong pixels.

### Rule 1: the execute lambda must be trivially destructible

The graph stores its closure in an arena that frees memory without a destructor call. A
`static_assert` in `add_pass` enforces this. Capture handles, raw GPU handles (`WGPUBindGroup`,
`WGPURenderPipeline`), plain values, and `this` by value. Never capture a `std::string`, a smart
pointer, a container, or an RAII wrapper.

```cpp
// OK: raw handle pulled out at declaration time.
[pipeline = m_pipeline->pipeline().handle()](webgpu::rg::PassContext& ctx) { ... }
// Compile error: std::string is not trivially destructible.
[label = std::string("debug")](webgpu::rg::PassContext& ctx) { ... }
```

### Rule 2: never pre-build a bind group over a transient's view

The graph does not choose a transient's real GPU texture until `execute()`, and it can change frame to
frame through pooling and aliasing. A bind group built outside the pass body points at stale or wrong
memory. Build bind groups inside the execute lambda, as a body-local `webgpu::raii::BindGroup`, from
`ctx.bind(...)` entries:

```cpp
[this, result](webgpu::rg::PassContext& c) {
    webgpu::raii::BindGroup bg(c.device, *m_layout, {
        c.bind(0, result),                     // graph resource -> ctx.bind
        m_ubo->create_bind_group_entry(1),     // app-owned static -> its own helper
    }, "blit");
    wgpuRenderPassEncoderSetBindGroup(c.render_pass, 0, bg.handle(), 0, nullptr);
    wgpuRenderPassEncoderDraw(c.render_pass, 3, 1, 0, 0);
}
```

The body-local group is safe to destroy at end of scope. The encoder keeps its own reference once
`SetBindGroup` records it.

The same rule forbids a cached transient view that you bind raw in a later pass. That read is
undeclared, so the aliaser can hand its memory to another transient, and the cached view reads the
wrong pixels. This bug shows only with aliasing on. See
[Undeclared reads and aliasing](#undeclared-reads-and-aliasing) and the `compile(false)` row in
[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

Mixing rule: any resource a graph pass touches binds with `ctx.bind(handle)`, so the graph can order
and alias it. A static or externally-synced object, such as a static UBO or an app-owned shadow map,
binds with its own `create_bind_group_entry()` or the free `webgpu::bind()` overloads (in
`webgpu/base/gpu_utils.h`):

```cpp
WGPUBindGroupEntry bind(uint32_t binding, WGPUTextureView view);
WGPUBindGroupEntry bind(uint32_t binding, WGPUSampler sampler);
WGPUBindGroupEntry bind(uint32_t binding, WGPUBuffer buffer, uint64_t offset, uint64_t size);
```

---

## Ordering and culling

You never write the dependencies by hand. The graph derives the order from your access declarations. A
`sampled(x)` runs after whatever `color(x)` or `storage_write(x)` produced `x`. To chain two passes,
write a fresh transient in the producer, capture the handle, and declare it as a read in the consumer:

```cpp
auto out = producer(rg);          // returns a handle it wrote
consumer(rg, /*reads*/ out);      // declares b.sampled(out) -> ordered after producer
```

Read-after-write and write-after-write both become ordering edges. Write-after-write keeps declaration
order. Declare the producing pass before its readers, def before use.

Below, `Bake` writes `lut` and `Shade` reads it: one edge, one order. `DebugDump` writes only a plain
transient that nobody reads, so it never reaches a sink and `compile()` drops it (dashed):

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Bake["Bake"] --> lut(["lut"])
    lut --> Shade["Shade"]
    Shade --> out(["shaded"])
    out --> swap[["swapchain<br/>(sink)"]]

    Dump["DebugDump<br/>(culled)"] -.-> scratch(["scratch<br/>(no reader)"])

    classDef dead fill:#8883,stroke-dasharray:4 3,color:#888;
    class Dump,scratch dead;
```

To keep `DebugDump` (readback, indirect-arg generation, a bake nobody reads this frame), mark it
`force_keep()` or gate it with `initialize()`.

`compile()` drops every pass whose output nothing needs. The graph keeps a pass only if it
transitively feeds a sink:

| Sink | Why it counts |
| --- | --- |
| A read by another surviving pass | ordinary producer/consumer dependency |
| A write to an imported resource | the value leaves the frame (e.g. the swapchain) |
| A write to a history `.curr` | it becomes next frame's `.prev` |
| A `force_keep()` pass | explicit side-effect root |

A pass that only writes a plain transient nobody reads is dead, and the graph silently culls it. It
leaves the debug panel and GPU timings. If your pass has a side effect the graph cannot see (readback,
indirect-arg generation, a bake nobody reads this frame), mark it `force_keep()` or gate it with
`initialize()`.

---

## Pass groups

A `.` in a pass name creates a group. The span before the first dot is the group name. Passes that
share it are bracketed together in GPU captures and drawn as one region in the RenderGraph panel.
Names cost nothing and make a 40-pass frame readable.

```cpp
rg->add_pass("bloom.threshold", ...);
rg->add_pass("bloom.blurH",     ...);
rg->add_pass("bloom.blurV",     ...);
rg->add_pass("bloom.composite", ...);
```

Grouping is a labelling feature only. It has no effect on ordering, culling, aliasing, usage
inference, or correctness. A pass with no dot in its name belongs to no group.

### What the group drives

During `execute()`, the graph brackets each run of same-group passes in a command-encoder debug group
with `wgpuCommandEncoderPushDebugGroup` and `PopDebugGroup`. A RenderDoc, PIX, or Xcode capture then
shows `bloom` as one collapsible region that contains its four passes, instead of four unrelated
entries.

The panel uses the same prefix to draw the run inside one bordered region and to keep it as a single
block in the layout. So a group stays together on screen instead of scattered by the dependency
columns. A region needs at least two passes. A lone `bloom.threshold` draws as an ordinary box.

### Nesting with more dots

The encoder debug group uses the first segment only. The panel goes further and builds a tree from the
remaining segments. So `bloom.down.0` and `bloom.down.1` nest under `bloom.down`, which nests under
`bloom`. Each level collapses on its own, and the panel remembers the collapse state per prefix across
frames.

```cpp
rg->add_pass("bloom.down.0", ...);   // panel: bloom > down > 0
rg->add_pass("bloom.down.1", ...);
rg->add_pass("bloom.up.0",   ...);   // panel: bloom > up > 0
```

As with the top level, a nested level needs at least two members to become its own subgroup.

### Groups follow execution order, not declaration order

The graph computes the run over passes in execution order, which `compile()` derives from your
declarations. Passes that share a prefix but do not end up scheduled next to each other produce two
separate debug groups with the same name, not one merged region.

This is usually invisible, because a group is normally a chain and a chain schedules consecutively. It
shows when an unrelated pass gets scheduled into the middle of a group, for example when a group
member reads a resource produced late. If a group looks split in a capture, check the Graph tab for
what landed between its members.

Culling applies first. A culled pass is not in the execution order at all, so it contributes nothing
to its group. A group whose members are all culled disappears.

By convention, resource names use dots too, as in `gbuffer.albedo` and `clouds.lo_color`. That is for
readability in the labels and error messages. Only pass names form groups.

## Views and ViewRange

`ctx.view(h)` returns a view whose shape matches what you declared: same base mip and layer, same
`ViewRange`. You never build a `WGPUTextureViewDescriptor`.

Which subresource you mean is part of the same option struct as everything else. `sampled()` and the
`storage_*()` family take a `ViewRange`, whose `baseMip`/`baseLayer` default to 0. Attachments and
copies take a `Subresource` instead, since they address exactly one mip and one layer.

```cpp
b.sampled(tex, { .baseMip = 2 });                                      // read mip 2
b.color(tex, 0, { .sub = { .mip = 3 } });                              // render into mip 3
// In the body, fetch a specific subresource explicitly:
WGPUTextureView mip2 = c.view(tex, 2);        // mip 2, layer 0
auto entry           = c.bind(0, tex, 2);     // same view, as a bind-group entry
```

`ViewRange` is how you name more than one subresource: a mip chain, an array slice, a cubemap, or a
single aspect of a depth-stencil texture. It is the optional last argument of `sampled()` and the
`storage_*()` family. Attachments take a `Subresource` instead, since a render target is always one
mip and one layer.

Write it with designated initializers. The fields are same-typed, so a positional `{ 1, 2, 0, 6 }`
compiles happily while it means something else entirely. The `cube()`, `cube_array()` and `whole()`
helpers return a ready-made range, and `.at(mip, layer)` rebases one: `cube().at(0, 4)` is cube face
4. The shape you declare here is the shape `ctx.view(h)` hands back in the body.

### The default is one subresource

Every field has a default that suits a plain 2D texture. So `{}` (what you get when you omit it) means
one mip, one layer, all aspects, dimension inferred. Set a field only when that is not what you want.

### mipCount and layerCount count forward, and 0 means the rest

Both are counts from the base, not indices. `b.sampled(tex, { .baseMip = 2, .mipCount = 3 })` is mips
2, 3, and 4.

`0` is the useful special case: all remaining from the base. Prefer it to a count by hand. An
over-wide count is the usual cause of a `"declares a view of …"` compile error, and `0` cannot
overrun.

```cpp
b.sampled(prefiltered, { .mipCount = 0 });              // the whole mip chain
b.sampled(cascades,    { .layerCount = 4 });            // layers 0..3, as a 2DArray
b.sampled(cascades,    { .baseLayer = 2, .layerCount = 0 }); // layer 2 to the end
```

### dim is inferred unless you set it

`dim` defaults to `Undefined`, which resolves to `3D` for a 3D texture, else `2DArray` when the view
covers more than one layer, else `2D`. That is right nearly always. Set it explicitly for a cube, or
to force `2DArray` over a single layer when the shader binding says `texture_2d_array`.

### aspect picks a plane

For a combined depth-stencil format, say which plane a sampled read means:

```cpp
b.sampled(depth, { .aspect = WGPUTextureAspect_DepthOnly });
```

### Layers come from the texture, not the range

`layerCount` can only slice the layers the texture actually has, and array layers live in
`TextureDesc::depthOrLayers` of a 2D texture. That field applies under both `SizeKind`s. A `Relative`
texture scales its width and height off the base but keeps its own layer count. An array is 2D with
more than one layer, not `WGPUTextureDimension_3D`. Confuse the two and you get a `3D` view where you
wanted an array, or a range error:

```cpp
// 2D array, not 3D. the 4th argument is the layer count.
auto cascades = rg->create_transient_texture("shadow.cascades",
    rg::texture_2d_array(WGPUTextureFormat_Depth32Float, 2048, 2048, 4));
b.sampled(cascades, { .layerCount = 4 });    // -> 2DArray of 4
```

### Cubes: use the helpers

Cube views have strict rules: exactly 6 layers, a positive multiple of 6 for an array, and a 2D
source. Three constexpr helpers spell them out correctly. `whole()` is the everything-from-the-base
shorthand:

```cpp
b.sampled(envMap,      webgpu::rg::cube());        // 6 layers, dim Cube
b.sampled(probes,      webgpu::rg::cube_array(4)); // 4 cubes = 24 layers
b.sampled(prefiltered, webgpu::rg::whole());       // every mip and layer
// each helper also takes an aspect and a mipCount:
b.sampled(envMap, webgpu::rg::cube(WGPUTextureAspect_All, /*mipCount*/ 0)); // cube + full chain
```

`compile()` checks the rest and names the offending pass and resource: a cube that covers other than 6
layers, a cube array not a multiple of 6, a base plus count past the last layer, or a cube view of a
non-2D texture. One rule has no workaround: a cube view on a `storage_read` or `storage_write` is an
error, because WebGPU storage textures cannot be cube. Sample it as a cube, or bind it as a `2DArray`
for storage.

### Recipe: generate a mip chain

A copy cannot resize, so mip generation is a blit pass per level: sample mip `i`, render into mip
`i+1`, same handle, two subresources. Hazard tracking is whole-resource, so the chain serializes level
by level, which is the order you want anyway.

You must create the texture with the levels it is about to fill. `TextureDesc::mipLevelCount` defaults
to 1 and there is no `0` meaning all, so spell the chain out. A loop past the declared count is the
`"is accessed at mip …"` compile error:

```cpp
constexpr uint32_t kMips = 8;
// .mips() is required, without it the texture has one mip
auto tex = rg->create_transient_texture("prefiltered",
    rg::texture_2d(WGPUTextureFormat_RGBA16Float, 256, 256).mips(kMips));

for (uint32_t mip = 1; mip < kMips; ++mip) {
    rg->add_pass(names[mip], webgpu::rg::PassKind::Graphics, // names[] must outlive each add_pass call
        [&](webgpu::rg::PassBuilder& b) {
            b.sampled(tex, { .baseMip = mip - 1 });     // read mip i-1
            b.color(tex, 0, { .sub = { .mip = mip } });  // write mip i
        },
        [tex, mip, layout = m_blitLayout.handle()](webgpu::rg::PassContext& c) {
            webgpu::raii::BindGroup group(c.device, layout, { c.bind(0, tex, mip - 1) }, "mip blit");
            wgpuRenderPassEncoderSetBindGroup(c.render_pass, 0, group.handle(), 0, nullptr);
            wgpuRenderPassEncoderDraw(c.render_pass, 3, 1, 0, 0);
        });
}
```

## Buffers

Declare buffers with `create_transient_buffer`, `create_persistent_buffer`, or
`create_history_buffer`, each of which takes a `BufferDesc { size }`. `import_buffer` takes the
caller's `WGPUBuffer` instead of a desc, since the object already has its size. The graph infers the
usage flags from how the passes declare the buffer. You never set `WGPUBufferUsage` yourself:

| Declaration | Inferred usage | WGSL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `b.uniform(h)` | Uniform | `var<uniform>` |
| `b.storage_read(h)` | Storage (read) | `var<storage, read>` |
| `b.storage_write(h)` / `b.storage_read_write(h)` | Storage (write / read_write) | `var<storage, read_write>` |
| `b.vertex_buffer(h)` | Vertex | vertex fetch |
| `b.index_buffer(h)` | Index | index fetch |
| `b.indirect_buffer(h)` | Indirect | draw/dispatch indirect args |
| `b.host_write(h)` | CopyDst | filled via `wgpuQueueWriteBuffer` in the body |
| `b.copy_buffer(src,dst,…)` | CopySrc / CopyDst | see copies |

`ctx.buffer(h)` gives the `WGPUBuffer`, and `ctx.buffer_size(h)` its realized size.
`ctx.bind(binding, h)` makes a whole-buffer binding at offset 0 with the realized size, unless the
declaration carried a `BufferRange` (below).

### Binding a sub-range

`uniform()` and the `storage_*()` buffer declarations take an optional `BufferRange { offset, size }`,
the buffer analog of `ViewRange`. The shape you declare is the shape `ctx.bind(binding, h)` hands back.
`size = 0` (the default) means all remaining bytes from `offset`, resolved at declare time.

```cpp
// bind the second 256-byte slice of a packed parameter buffer
b.uniform(params, { .offset = 256, .size = 256 });
b.storage_read(packed, { .offset = 512 });   // byte 512 to the end
```

Constraints, all checked at `compile()`: the range must fit the buffer, must not be empty, and
`offset` must be a multiple of 256, the spec-default uniform/storage offset alignment. One range per
buffer per pass. Two bind declarations that give the same buffer different ranges are ambiguous and
assert in `ctx.bind`. Hazard tracking stays whole-resource, so two passes that touch disjoint ranges
of one buffer still order serially. Use separate transients if that matters.

```cpp
auto args = rg->create_transient_buffer("cull.args", { .size = 16 });

rg->add_pass("Cull", webgpu::rg::PassKind::Compute,
    [args, ids](webgpu::rg::PassBuilder& b) {
        b.storage_read(ids);
        b.storage_write(args);      // -> Storage usage on args
    },
    [this, args, ids](webgpu::rg::PassContext& c) {
        webgpu::raii::BindGroup bg(c.device, *m_cull_layout,
            { c.bind(0, ids), c.bind(1, args) }, "cull");
        wgpuComputePassEncoderSetPipeline(c.compute_pass, m_cull_pipeline);
        wgpuComputePassEncoderSetBindGroup(c.compute_pass, 0, bg.handle(), 0, nullptr);
        wgpuComputePassEncoderDispatchWorkgroups(c.compute_pass, groups, 1, 1);
    });
// A later Graphics pass declares b.indirect_buffer(args) -> args gains Indirect usage
// and the draw is ordered after Cull.
```

---

## Attachments

The graph schedules the passes and wires the attachments. The pass body owns the pipeline (blend,
depth-stencil state, `multisample.count`). The graph does not validate formats. Dawn does.

### Color and depth

`color()` and `depth_stencil()` declare a write into one subresource (a render target is always one
mip, one layer). Their load and store ops are plain WebGPU, passed through untouched: `Clear` starts
from the clear value, `Load` keeps what is there, `Store` keeps the result, `Discard` throws it away.

`color()` takes the attachment slot explicitly, right after the handle. It is the `@location` the
fragment shader writes, not the order you declare in. Slots can be sparse, but one slot twice in a
pass is an error.

```cpp
// Slot 0, clear to opaque black, keep the result:
b.color(target, 0);                                           // defaults: Clear, Store, {0,0,0,1}
// Draw over what a previous pass produced (composite, overlays, tracks):
b.color(target, 0, { .load = WGPULoadOp_Load });
// Depth attachment, reverse-Z: clear to 0.0 and pair with a Greater/GreaterEqual pipeline.
b.depth_stencil(depth, { .clearDepth = 0.0f });
```

A multi-target pass names one slot per `color()`, matching its fragment shader's `@location`s, plus an
optional `depth_stencil()`:

```cpp
rg->add_pass("Tiles", webgpu::rg::PassKind::Graphics,
    [albedo, position, normal, gdepth](webgpu::rg::PassBuilder& b) {
        b.color(albedo,   0, { .clear = { 0, 0, 0, 0 } });
        b.color(position, 1, { .clear = { 0, 0, 0, 0 } });
        b.color(normal,   2, { .clear = { 0, 0, 0, 0 } });
        b.depth_stencil(gdepth, { .clearDepth = 0.0f }); // reverse-Z
    },
    [this](webgpu::rg::PassContext& c) { /* set bind groups + pipeline; draw */ });
```

Up to 8 color attachments (`kMaxColorAttachments`). A test-only pass that reads depth without a write
declares `depth_stencil_read_only(depth)`, the cheapest way to avoid a false write hazard.

### MSAA and resolve

`TextureDesc::sampleCount = 4` makes a texture multisampled (WebGPU 1.0 allows 1 or 4). MSAA and
non-MSAA textures never alias each other.

`resolve(src, target)` declares `target` as the single-sample resolve of `src`. The `src` handle must
already have a `color()` declaration in this pass, or you get an error that names the pass. Each color
attachment takes at most one resolve target.

```cpp
auto msaaColor = rg->create_transient_texture("msaa.color",
    rg::texture_2d(kColorFormat, w, h).samples(4));
auto msaaDepth = rg->create_transient_texture("msaa.depth",
    rg::texture_2d(WGPUTextureFormat_Depth32Float, w, h).samples(4));
auto resolved  = rg->create_transient_texture("resolved",
    rg::texture_2d(kColorFormat, w, h)); // single-sample

rg->add_pass("forward.msaa", webgpu::rg::PassKind::Graphics,
    [&](webgpu::rg::PassBuilder& b) {
        b.color(msaaColor, 0);              // multisample color
        b.resolve(msaaColor, resolved);     // src must already be declared as a color()
        b.depth_stencil(msaaDepth);         // depth is NOT resolved
    },
    [pipeline = msaaPipe](webgpu::rg::PassContext& ctx) {
        // pipeline MUST be built with .multisample = { .count = 4, .mask = ~0u }
        wgpuRenderPassEncoderSetPipeline(ctx.render_pass, pipeline);
        wgpuRenderPassEncoderDraw(ctx.render_pass, 3, 1, 0, 0);
    });
```

The resolve target can be an imported texture, and it resolves straight into the swapchain:
`b.resolve(msaaColor, swapchain)`. Dawn enforces the rest: every attachment in one pass shares one
`sampleCount` equal to the pipeline's; a resolve target is single-sample with the same format and size
as its color; depth and stencil cannot be resolved through a render pass.

### Stencil

Use a depth+stencil format (`Depth24PlusStencil8`, `Depth32FloatStencil8`) and pass the stencil load,
store, and clear to `depth_stencil()`. The graph only carries the attachment's load, store, and clear.
The actual stencil compare and write live in the pipeline's `WGPUDepthStencilState`. The stencil
params default to `Undefined`, so depth-only formats are unaffected. Leave them out.

```cpp
// Pass 1: write the mask (pipeline: stencil passOp = Replace, ref = 1).
b.depth_stencil(ds, { .stencilLoad = WGPULoadOp_Clear, .stencilStore = WGPUStoreOp_Store });
// Pass 2: effect only where stencil == 1 (pipeline: compare = Equal, ref = 1).
b.depth_stencil_read_only(ds); // test only -> reads ds, orders after the mask pass
b.color(outColor, 0, { .load = WGPULoadOp_Load });
```

`depth_stencil_read_only()` marks both depth and stencil read-only. You cannot express a read-only
stencil while depth stays writable. They share one flag.

---

## Compute passes

`PassKind::Compute` gives you `ctx.compute_pass`. Declare the storage, sampled, and uniform accesses in
setup. Build the bind group in the body from `ctx.bind(...)` and dispatch. A pass that writes a storage
target and a later pass that samples it are ordered automatically.

```cpp
rg->add_pass("CloudsRender", webgpu::rg::PassKind::Compute,
    [lo_color, lo_depth, gbuffer_depth](webgpu::rg::PassBuilder& b) {
        b.storage_write(lo_color);   // binding 4 (rgba16float)
        b.storage_write(lo_depth);   // binding 5 (r32float)
        b.sampled(gbuffer_depth);    // ordering only: bound via a pre-built depth bind group
    },
    [this, lo_color, lo_depth, depth_bg, shared_config_bg](webgpu::rg::PassContext& c) {
        webgpu::raii::BindGroup bind_group(c.device,
            m_ctx->resource_registry().bind_group_layout("render_clouds"),
            {
                m_params_ubo->raw_buffer().create_bind_group_entry(0),  // static
                m_atlas_view->create_bind_group_entry(1),               // static
                c.bind(4, lo_color),                                    // graph storage-write
                c.bind(5, lo_depth),
            }, "CloudsRender");
        wgpuComputePassEncoderSetPipeline(c.compute_pass, m_render_pipeline->handle());
        wgpuComputePassEncoderSetBindGroup(c.compute_pass, 0, bind_group.handle(), 0, nullptr);
        wgpuComputePassEncoderSetBindGroup(c.compute_pass, 1, depth_bg, 0, nullptr);
        wgpuComputePassEncoderSetBindGroup(c.compute_pass, 2, shared_config_bg, 0, nullptr);
        wgpuComputePassEncoderDispatchWorkgroups(c.compute_pass,
            ceil_div(res.x, 8u), ceil_div(res.y, 8u), 1);
    });
```

Dawn auto-synchronizes storage and sampled transitions between compute passes, and between compute and
graphics. There are no manual barriers. A read and write in the same dispatch uses
`storage_read_write()`. In-dispatch races are the shader's responsibility.

---

## Transfer passes and copies

`PassKind::Transfer` gets no pass object. The body encodes copies directly on `ctx.encoder`. Each copy
method declares `CopySrc` on src and `CopyDst` on dst, and the ctx resolvers build the WebGPU copy
descriptors with the declared subresource applied.

Four copies are declarable: `copy_texture` (subresource to subresource, it cannot resize, so it is no
use for mip generation), `copy_texture_to_buffer` (readback and export), `copy_buffer_to_texture`
(host-staged upload), and `copy_buffer` (a byte range; offsets and size must be multiples of 4, and
src and dst must differ).

The resolvers give you one unambiguous handle and direction per pass. For several copies over one
resource, build the infos by hand through `ctx.texture()` and `ctx.buffer()`.

```cpp
// Buffer -> buffer (e.g. counter -> indirect args):
rg->add_pass("CopyArgs", webgpu::rg::PassKind::Transfer,
    [counter, indirectArgs](webgpu::rg::PassBuilder& b) {
        b.copy_buffer(counter, indirectArgs, 0, 0, 16);
    },
    [counter, indirectArgs](webgpu::rg::PassContext& ctx) {
        auto c = ctx.buffer_copy_info(counter, indirectArgs);   // size already expanded
        wgpuCommandEncoderCopyBufferToBuffer(ctx.encoder, c.src, c.srcOffset, c.dst, c.dstOffset, c.size);
    });
```

The buffer side of a texture copy is yours to describe, and WebGPU requires each row to start on a
256-byte boundary. `webgpu::rg::aligned_bytes_per_row(widthTexels, texelBlockBytes)` does that
rounding, so the readback buffer and the layout agree:

```cpp
// Texture -> buffer readback. The buffer-side layout is the body's; rows are 256-aligned.
rg->add_pass("Readback", webgpu::rg::PassKind::Transfer,
    [src, dst](webgpu::rg::PassBuilder& b) { b.copy_texture_to_buffer(src, dst); },
    [src, dst, w, h](webgpu::rg::PassContext& ctx) {
        WGPUTexelCopyBufferLayout layout {
            .offset = 0,
            .bytesPerRow  = webgpu::rg::aligned_bytes_per_row(w, /*texelBytes*/ 4),
            .rowsPerImage = h,
        };
        auto s  = ctx.copy_src_info(src);          // texture side, declared mip/layer applied
        auto d  = ctx.copy_dst_buffer(dst, layout); // buffer side, {layout, buffer}
        auto sz = ctx.copy_extent_src(src);
        wgpuCommandEncoderCopyTextureToBuffer(ctx.encoder, &s, &d, &sz);
    });
```

Hazard tracking is whole-resource: two copies over disjoint ranges of the same pair still order
serially. A copy of an imported texture requires that the import passed its backing `WGPUTexture`.
`execute()` does not auto-encode copies. The body calls `wgpu*` directly, the same contract as every
other pass kind.

---

## initialize() and hash-gated rebakes

`initialize()` marks a pass as the baker for a pool-backed resource: a persistent texture or buffer, or
a history `.curr`. You still declare the write normally (`color()`, `storage_write()`, a copy).
`initialize()` only decides whether the pass runs this frame. The graph runs it only when the target
needs a rebake. Otherwise the graph skips it and culls the pass, so it leaves the panel and timings, on
every frame the baked content is still valid. Readers bind the pooled result either way. Persistent
resources are external to the frame, so a reader resolves them with no in-graph writer.

Declare it in setup, alongside the write it gates:

```cpp
// Bake a BRDF or atmosphere LUT once, then reuse the pooled texture every frame.
auto lut = rg->create_persistent_texture("brdf.lut", lutDesc);

rg->add_pass("BakeBRDF", webgpu::rg::PassKind::Compute,
    [lut](webgpu::rg::PassBuilder& b) {
        b.storage_write(lut);   // the actual write
        b.initialize(lut);      // hash 0 -> bake once, then skip forever
    },
    [this, lut](webgpu::rg::PassContext& c) { /* dispatch the bake */ });
// Every later frame: BakeBRDF is skipped and culled; samplers still bind the pooled LUT.
```

### The rebake triggers

A pass gated by `initialize(target, hash)` runs when any of these holds. Otherwise the graph skips and
culls it:

| Trigger | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| First frame | the pool entry has never been realized or baked |
| Pool recreation | the entry was evicted, or resized or reformatted (a bigger usage set, a size/format/dim/mip/sample change). Recreation clears the baked flag |
| Hash mismatch | the `hash` you pass differs from the one stamped at the last bake |

A body bakes all its targets or none: one stale target re-arms the whole pass. The graph re-stamps the
hash when the pass actually runs, during `execute()`. So a frame that fails `compile()` never claims a
bake it did not perform.

### Ad-hoc rebuilding via the hash

`hash == 0` means bake once, never again. A non-zero hash turns `initialize()` into an on-demand
rebuild. Pass a value derived from every input the baked content depends on, and the bake re-runs
exactly on the frames that value changes. There is no dirty flag, no manual invalidation call, and no
rebuild every frame.

```cpp
// Rebake only when a setting that feeds the LUT changes. Any hash over those inputs works, the
// graph just compares it to the value stamped at the last bake:
uint64_t sig = std::hash<std::string_view> {}(
    { reinterpret_cast<const char*>(&lutParams), sizeof(lutParams) });  // explicit size, not strlen

rg->add_pass("BakeBRDF", webgpu::rg::PassKind::Compute,
    [lut, sig](webgpu::rg::PassBuilder& b) {
        b.storage_write(lut);
        b.initialize(lut, sig);   // re-runs only on the frame `sig` changes
    },
    [this, lut](webgpu::rg::PassContext& c) { /* dispatch the bake */ });
```

This is the same hash mechanism that history uses for
[camera cuts](#camera-cuts-via-the-history-hash): one number, changed when the content's identity
changes, and the graph rebuilds on that frame. Use it for LUTs that depend on tunables, precomputed
shadow or irradiance data keyed to sun direction, and any expensive result whose inputs change
occasionally but not per frame.

## Examples

Each example is a small slice of a real frame graph. They compose the pieces from the sections above:
MRT attachments, cross-stage ordering, relative sizing, history, persistent bakes, and imports. The
pass bodies are abbreviated to the graph-relevant calls. Pipeline creation and draw setup live in the
app.

### Deferred shading: G-buffer plus compute lighting

A Graphics pass fills a multi-target G-buffer. A Compute pass reads the three targets and writes a lit
storage texture. The graph derives the read-after-write edge from the declarations, so the compute
pass runs after the G-buffer with no manual barrier.

```cpp
auto albedo = rg->create_transient_texture("gbuffer.albedo",
    rg::texture_2d(WGPUTextureFormat_RGBA8Unorm,  w, h));
auto normal = rg->create_transient_texture("gbuffer.normal",
    rg::texture_2d(WGPUTextureFormat_RGBA16Float, w, h));
auto depth  = rg->create_transient_texture("gbuffer.depth",
    rg::texture_2d(WGPUTextureFormat_Depth32Float, w, h));
auto lit    = rg->create_transient_texture("lit.color",
    rg::texture_2d(WGPUTextureFormat_RGBA16Float, w, h));

rg->add_pass("GBuffer", webgpu::rg::PassKind::Graphics,
    [albedo, normal, depth](webgpu::rg::PassBuilder& b) {
        b.color(albedo, 0, { .clear = { 0, 0, 0, 0 } });
        b.color(normal, 1, { .clear = { 0, 0, 0, 0 } });
        b.depth_stencil(depth, { .clearDepth = 0.0f }); // reverse-Z
    },
    [this](webgpu::rg::PassContext& c) { draw_scene(c); });

rg->add_pass("Lighting", webgpu::rg::PassKind::Compute,
    [albedo, normal, depth, lit](webgpu::rg::PassBuilder& b) {
        b.sampled(albedo);
        b.sampled(normal);
        b.sampled(depth);         // depth-only format, so no aspect needed
        b.storage_write(lit);     // ordered after GBuffer by the reads above
    },
    [this, albedo, normal, depth, lit, lights_bg](webgpu::rg::PassContext& c) {
        webgpu::raii::BindGroup bg(c.device, *m_light_layout, {
            c.bind(0, albedo), c.bind(1, normal), c.bind(2, depth), c.bind(3, lit),
        }, "tiled-lighting");
        wgpuComputePassEncoderSetPipeline(c.compute_pass, m_light_pipeline);
        wgpuComputePassEncoderSetBindGroup(c.compute_pass, 0, bg.handle(), 0, nullptr);
        wgpuComputePassEncoderSetBindGroup(c.compute_pass, 1, lights_bg, 0, nullptr); // app-owned light list
        wgpuComputePassEncoderDispatchWorkgroups(c.compute_pass,
            ceil_div(size.width, 16u), ceil_div(size.height, 16u), 1); // one workgroup per 16x16 tile
    });
// return `lit` to the tonemap/composite pass.
```

For a tiled light culling prepass, add a `create_transient_buffer` for the per-tile light index list,
`storage_write` it in a cull compute pass, and `storage_read` it here. The cull pass then orders before
lighting.

### Bloom: relative-sized downsample chain

The bright-pass and blur targets are half resolution, sized with `Relative` so they follow the HDR
target through resizes. The chain is a sequence of transients, each written by one pass and read by the
next. The final composite loads the HDR target and adds the blurred bloom on top.

```cpp
const auto halfDesc = webgpu::rg::texture_relative(WGPUTextureFormat_RGBA16Float, hdrColor, 0.5f);
auto bright = rg->create_transient_texture("bloom.bright", halfDesc);
auto blurH  = rg->create_transient_texture("bloom.blur_h", halfDesc);
auto blurV  = rg->create_transient_texture("bloom.blur_v", halfDesc);

// A tiny helper: full-screen pass that samples one texture and writes another.
auto blit_pass = [&](const char* name, webgpu::rg::TextureHandle src,
                     webgpu::rg::TextureHandle dst, WGPURenderPipeline pipe) {
    rg->add_pass(name, webgpu::rg::PassKind::Graphics,
        [src, dst](webgpu::rg::PassBuilder& b) { b.sampled(src); b.color(dst, 0); },
        [this, src, pipe](webgpu::rg::PassContext& c) {
            webgpu::raii::BindGroup bg(c.device, *m_blit_layout, { c.bind(0, src) }, "bloom");
            wgpuRenderPassEncoderSetPipeline(c.render_pass, pipe);
            wgpuRenderPassEncoderSetBindGroup(c.render_pass, 0, bg.handle(), 0, nullptr);
            wgpuRenderPassEncoderDraw(c.render_pass, 3, 1, 0, 0);
        });
};

blit_pass("bloom.threshold", hdrColor, bright, m_threshold_pipe);
blit_pass("bloom.blurH",     bright,   blurH,  m_blur_h_pipe);
blit_pass("bloom.blurV",     blurH,    blurV,  m_blur_v_pipe);

// Composite: keep the HDR target, add bloom. Additive blend lives in m_add_pipe.
rg->add_pass("bloom.composite", webgpu::rg::PassKind::Graphics,
    [hdrColor, blurV](webgpu::rg::PassBuilder& b) {
        b.color(hdrColor, 0, { .load = WGPULoadOp_Load }); // load, do not clear
        b.sampled(blurV);
    },
    [this, blurV](webgpu::rg::PassContext& c) {
        webgpu::raii::BindGroup bg(c.device, *m_blit_layout, { c.bind(0, blurV) }, "bloom.add");
        wgpuRenderPassEncoderSetPipeline(c.render_pass, m_add_pipe);
        wgpuRenderPassEncoderSetBindGroup(c.render_pass, 0, bg.handle(), 0, nullptr);
        wgpuRenderPassEncoderDraw(c.render_pass, 3, 1, 0, 0);
    });
```

`bright` is dead after `bloom.blurH` reads it, so the aliaser can pack `blurV` onto the same memory.
The three half-res targets cost one or two physical textures, not three.

### TAA: history plus a camera-cut hash

TAA reads last frame's resolved color and blends it with the current frame. The history resource gives
the ping-pong pair. `history_valid` handles the first frame and any reset. The hash resets history on a
camera cut, so reprojection does not smear across the discontinuity.

```cpp
uint64_t cut = cameraCutCounter; // changes on teleport, projection swap, etc.
auto taa = rg->create_history_texture("taa.color", colorDesc, cut);

rg->add_pass("TAA", webgpu::rg::PassKind::Graphics,
    [currentColor, velocity, taa](webgpu::rg::PassBuilder& b) {
        b.sampled(currentColor);
        b.sampled(velocity);
        b.sampled(taa.prev);      // last frame's result
        b.color(taa.curr, 0);     // this frame's result, becomes next frame's prev
    },
    [this, currentColor, velocity, taa](webgpu::rg::PassContext& c) {
        float alpha = c.history_valid(taa) ? 0.9f : 0.0f; // 0 == ignore history this frame
        wgpuQueueWriteBuffer(c.queue, m_taa_ubo, 0, &alpha, sizeof(alpha)); // shader reads the blend weight
        webgpu::raii::BindGroup bg(c.device, *m_taa_layout, {
            c.bind(0, currentColor), c.bind(1, velocity), c.bind(2, taa.prev),
            webgpu::bind(3, m_taa_ubo, 0, sizeof(float)), // app-owned UBO
        }, "taa");
        wgpuRenderPassEncoderSetPipeline(c.render_pass, m_taa_pipe);
        wgpuRenderPassEncoderSetBindGroup(c.render_pass, 0, bg.handle(), 0, nullptr);
        wgpuRenderPassEncoderDraw(c.render_pass, 3, 1, 0, 0);
    });
// A later tonemap pass samples taa.curr for display.
```

A write to `taa.curr` makes the pass a sink, so the graph never culls it, even on a frame where nothing
downstream is declared yet.

### IBL: import an environment cube and bake a specular BRDF LUT

Two resources with different lifetimes back image-based lighting. The app loads the environment cubemap
once and imports it. The graph bakes the split-sum BRDF LUT once into a persistent texture and reuses
it every frame.

An imported cubemap registered view-only, meaning `.texture` left null, hands back the caller's cube
view as-is. The graph never builds a view for it, so `ctx.view()` ignores any `ViewRange` you declared
and `ctx.view(h, mip, layer)` asserts unless both are 0. Sample it with a plain `sampled()` and no
range.

`cube()` here is not merely redundant, it fails to compile the graph. The cube check validates against
the layer count in the import's `size`, which is 1 below, so `b.sampled(env, cube())` errors with
"(baseLayer 0 + 6 layers) exceeds the texture's 1 layer(s)". If you declare the real layer count in
`size`, it compiles, but on a view-only import the range still selects nothing. The `cube()` and
`cube_array()` helpers are for textures the graph builds views for.

That is the view-only case specifically, not imports in general. An import that does pass its backing
`texture` takes the ordinary path. The graph builds views from the `ViewRange` you declare, cube
helpers included, exactly as for a graph-owned texture.

```cpp
// App owns and keeps alive a cube WGPUTextureView. Register it view-only (no backing texture).
auto env = rg->import_texture("ibl.env",
    { .view = m_env_cube_view, .size = { envSize, envSize, 1 }, .format = WGPUTextureFormat_RGBA16Float });

// The split-sum BRDF LUT: a 2D rg16f table, baked once, then read every frame.
auto brdfLut = rg->create_persistent_texture("ibl.brdf_lut", rg::texture_2d(WGPUTextureFormat_RG16Float, 512, 512));

rg->add_pass("BakeBRDF", webgpu::rg::PassKind::Compute,
    [brdfLut](webgpu::rg::PassBuilder& b) {
        b.storage_write(brdfLut);
        b.initialize(brdfLut);   // hash 0: bake once, then the pass is skipped and culled
    },
    [this, brdfLut](webgpu::rg::PassContext& c) {
        webgpu::raii::BindGroup bg(c.device, *m_brdf_layout, { c.bind(0, brdfLut) }, "bake-brdf");
        wgpuComputePassEncoderSetPipeline(c.compute_pass, m_brdf_pipe);
        wgpuComputePassEncoderSetBindGroup(c.compute_pass, 0, bg.handle(), 0, nullptr);
        wgpuComputePassEncoderDispatchWorkgroups(c.compute_pass, 512 / 8, 512 / 8, 1);
    });

// The lighting pass consumes both. `env` is imported and `brdfLut` is persistent, so neither
// needs an in-graph writer this frame for the reads to resolve.
rg->add_pass("IBL", webgpu::rg::PassKind::Graphics,
    [env, brdfLut, gbuffer_normal, lit](webgpu::rg::PassBuilder& b) {
        b.sampled(env);            // imported cube view, returned as registered
        b.sampled(brdfLut);
        b.sampled(gbuffer_normal);
        b.color(lit, 0, { .load = WGPULoadOp_Load });
    },
    [this, env, brdfLut, gbuffer_normal](webgpu::rg::PassContext& c) {
        webgpu::raii::BindGroup bg(c.device, *m_ibl_layout, {
            c.bind(0, env), c.bind(1, brdfLut), c.bind(2, gbuffer_normal),
            m_ibl_sampler->create_bind_group_entry(3), // app-owned sampler
        }, "ibl");
        wgpuRenderPassEncoderSetPipeline(c.render_pass, m_ibl_pipe);
        wgpuRenderPassEncoderSetBindGroup(c.render_pass, 0, bg.handle(), 0, nullptr);
        wgpuRenderPassEncoderDraw(c.render_pass, 3, 1, 0, 0);
    });
```

### Prefiltered specular: bake a mip-per-roughness cube

The import above is view-only, so `sampled(env)` returns whatever view the app registered, and the
graph has no say in its mip coverage. To let the graph own the roughness chain, make the prefiltered
specular map a graph-owned persistent cube instead. Then the graph honors the range you declare, and
`cube(All, 0)` binds every roughness level.

Storage textures cannot be cube, so the bake renders each face and mip as a color attachment: one pass
per (mip, layer), each of which declares its own subresource write and gates on the same `initialize()`
target so the whole set bakes together. Key the hash on the environment's identity to rebake when the
sky changes.

```cpp
constexpr uint32_t kFaces = 6;
constexpr uint32_t kRoughnessMips = 5; // roughness 0..1 across the chain

// texture_cube() takes one size, so the faces are square by construction
auto prefiltered = rg->create_persistent_texture("ibl.prefiltered",
    rg::texture_cube(WGPUTextureFormat_RGBA16Float, 128).mips(kRoughnessMips));

uint64_t envId = m_env_cube_hash; // changes when the loaded environment changes
for (uint32_t mip = 0; mip < kRoughnessMips; ++mip)
    for (uint32_t face = 0; face < kFaces; ++face)
        rg->add_pass("ibl.prefilter", webgpu::rg::PassKind::Graphics,
            [prefiltered, mip, face](webgpu::rg::PassBuilder& b) {
                b.color(prefiltered, 0, { .sub = { .mip = mip, .layer = face } }); // one face+mip
                b.initialize(prefiltered, envId);   // whole set bakes once, rebakes when envId changes
            },
            [this, mip, face](webgpu::rg::PassContext& c) { /* draw the prefiltered face at this mip */ });
```

The lighting pass then samples it as a whole-chain cube. Because `prefiltered` is graph-owned, the
graph builds the `cube()` range, and `mipCount = 0` means every roughness level:

```cpp
// ...in the IBL pass setup, alongside b.sampled(env) etc.:
b.sampled(prefiltered, webgpu::rg::cube(WGPUTextureAspect_All, /*mipCount*/ 0));
// ...in the body:
c.bind(4, prefiltered);   // the shader picks the mip: textureSampleLevel(cube, s, dir, roughness * maxMip)
```

The bakes gate on `initialize(prefiltered, envId)`, so all `kFaces * kRoughnessMips` passes run the
first frame and whenever `envId` changes. Otherwise the graph skips and culls them. The pooled cube
survives, so the lighting pass keeps a bind to it.

## Debugging

### The error model

Authoring errors, such as a read of a transient before any pass writes it or a cyclic dependency, do
not throw. Instead:

1. `compile()` poisons the graph and enters a Failed state.
2. `compile()` returns a chain of `ErrorMessage { WGPUStringView message; ErrorMessage* next; }`, null
   when healthy. It is `[[nodiscard]]`, so a missing check is a compiler warning. `get_errors()`
   returns the same chain later in the same frame, for code that does not compile the graph itself. The
   chain lives in the frame arena, so read it before the next `begin_frame()`. To hold it past that
   asserts. Copy the text out if you need it to outlive the frame.
3. `execute()` becomes a no-op. Nothing is recorded and nothing crashes. Anything rendered outside the
   graph still works.

A poisoned graph therefore shows as a black scene while the UI keeps running. Loop the chain that
`compile()` hands back (see [The frame loop](#the-frame-loop)). It is your only signal. Messages also
appear as a red banner in the RenderGraph panel.

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Black scene, UI still fine | Graph poisoned; `execute()` is a no-op | Read `get_errors()` or the red banner |
| `"read before write"` | A pass reads a transient no earlier pass writes | Add or reorder the producer, or make it an import/history/initialized resource |
| `"accessed at mip/layer …"`, `"declares a view of …"`, `"range … covers bytes …"`, `"starts at byte …"`, `"not 256-byte aligned"` | A declared range does not fit the resource: a `baseMip`/`baseLayer` past the end, a `ViewRange` count that overruns, a `copy_buffer` or `BufferRange` past a buffer's end, or a bind offset off the 256-byte alignment | Fix the range on the `b.*()` call. `mipCount`/`layerCount`/`size` of 0 means all remaining and always fits |
| `"cycle"` but no real cycle | Whole-resource tracking: two passes touch disjoint ranges of the same two resources in opposite directions | Split into two handles. Transients are pooled, extra ones are nearly free |
| Pass missing from panel/timings | Culled, nothing reads its output | `force_keep()` or `initialize()`, or wire a real consumer |
| Crash or garbage in a bind group | Broke Rule 2 (pre-built bind group over a transient) | Build it inside the execute body from `ctx.bind` |
| Won't compile at `add_pass` | Broke Rule 1 (non-trivial capture) | Capture raw handles and values, not `std::string`/RAII |
| Bug vanishes with `compile(false)` | A transient lifetime is mis-declared, usually a read that was never declared because the object was bound raw from a cached view | Search pass bodies for `webgpu::bind(` on a view that traces back to a graph transient; declare the read and use `ctx.bind` instead (see [Undeclared reads and aliasing](#undeclared-reads-and-aliasing)) |

### The RenderGraph panel

Open it from the floating toolbar (project-diagram icon). Every frame it shows FPS and frame time, the
graph's own CPU cost (`compile`/`realize`/`execute` µs), and the red compile-failed banner. Four tabs:

- Graph: the frame's DAG, one box per pass, colored by kind, with dependency columns and sinks on the
  right. Reads on the left edge, writes on the right; hollow pins are external inputs; history edges
  are dashed. First place to look for "why does B run before A" or "why was my pass culled".
- Lifetimes: per-resource first-use to last-use spans. Shows how aliasing packed disjoint lifetimes
  onto shared memory and how much VRAM it saved.
- Memory: every pool and the graph's total VRAM.
- Timings: per-pass GPU time over 256 frames (needs profiling, below).

### GPU profiling

Opt-in. Needs the `TimestampQuery` device feature.

```cpp
rg->execute(device, queue, encoder, /*enableProfiling*/ true);
// ...submit...
rg->collect_gpu_timings();   // kicks async readback; safe to call always
```

The results arrive through the instance event pump a few frames later, not the same frame. The panel
header and Timings tab display them as they arrive.
